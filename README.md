## Hi there, I'm Evan. I am currently a Grad Student at California State University, Sacramento working on an MS in Civil Engineering with a Water Resources Engineering Focus. I also work at the US Geological Survey as a Hydologic Technician in the Sacramento / San Joaquin Delta. 

I have an interest in learning about how water systems interract with the environment and how we may be able to construct and manage watershed features to benefit both people and the natural world. 

Skills: ArcGIS, Adobe CS. 
Some experience with: HEC-RAS, R, C++, Java, Python

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting familiar with GitHub and a Network Analyst tool in ArcGIS
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all sorts of water science things at USGS and in school
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love bikepacking and probably have more routes planned than I can accomplish
